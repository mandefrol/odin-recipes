        Marqa/Genfo is a traditional and hearty porridge that holds a prominent place in Ethiopian cuisine, particularly as a staple breakfast food and a dish of cultural significance. It is made by slowly cooking flour—most commonly barley flour (gebs duket), though wheat or oat flour can also be used—in boiling water while vigorously stirring with a wooden tool called a mogogo/bojito. This process creates a thick, smooth, and dense dough-like consistency, which is then served in a mound with a deep well made in its center. This well is generously filled with a mixture of spiced clarified butter (niter kibbeh) and red berbere pepper, which slowly seeps into the hot porridge, along with optional additions like yogurt or milk. The result is a comforting, energy-dense meal known for its ability to sustain people through long mornings, especially in the cooler highland regions.

        Beyond its nutritional role, Genfo carries deep social and ritual importance. It is a customary dish prepared for nursing mothers to support recovery and lactation, and it is a central feature in celebrations like the Ethiopian New Year (Enkutatash). Most notably, Genfo is traditionally served on Tsedat (the eve of Epiphany) and during the Gena (Christmas) season, where its sharing symbolizes community, blessing, and renewal. The act of communal eating from a shared platter reinforces family and social bonds. Thus, Genfo is more than a simple porridge; it is a food woven into the fabric of Ethiopian life, marking both daily sustenance and key cultural moments with its distinctive, warming presence.
